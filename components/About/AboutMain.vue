            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>For three years, I’ve been working in a web agency as a integrator and front end developer. This role has always appealed most. Thus, I’m able to ally code and UX design. When building,  i’m thinking about what’s important for visitors : creative but still accessible and responsive web experiences. That’s what I love about my job!
